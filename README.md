## .::..:.::. dotfiles .::.:..::.

This is where I continuously upload optimizations to my environment.  
Say hello to my workspace.  

## Getting Started

### Install this repo

`git clone https://github.com/theshteves/dotfiles.git`

### Copy desired into your home directory

`cd ./dotfiles/`

`cp [desired config files] ~/`

## Inspiration

Above all, I owe my brother [Matt Kneiser](github.com/themattman) who I initially cloned this project from before starting from scratch.
